This result was obtained by calculating eRIDE with the 
                 following parameters. A forest pixel was considered any pixel 
                 with a forest cover types from globcover 2019 (Hansen et al. 2022) (codes  51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 ). Then, we converted forest area for each patch into species number 
(biodiversity) by using species-area formula as a Biodiversity = cA^Z, 
where c =  1 and z = 0.2. After that we extract data from patch boundaries and weight them 
by patch biodiversity values. 
Then, we calculate eRIDE, which is a sum of 
the weighted boundaries within a radius of 25pixels, wich means 696.1 696.1 meters, considering a circular custom gaussian weighted matrix,
used to create an eRIDE surface for our entire region of interest.
