"This result was obtained by calculating eRIDE with the following parameters. A forest pixel was considered any pixel with a forest cover fraction higher than0.2. Then, we converted forest area for each patch into species number (biodiversity) by using species-area formula as a Biodiversity = cA^Z, wher c = 1and z = 0.2. After that we extract data from patch boundaries and weight them by patch biodiversity values. 
Then, we calculate eRIDE, which is a sum of the weighted boundaries within a radius of25pixels, wich means 0.01 meters, considering a circular custom gaussian weighted matrix, used to create an eRIDE surface for our entire region of interest."
