# Create a binary image of forest areas - here, this is raster values between 51 and 115.
# Saves the output as a grass environment layer called "r"
# Choose land cover for map layer

## Use the present script ONLY for strata folder data. (layers 5,6,12 and 13 are considered forest).
## STRATA LAYER DATA:
# 1	True desert	⩾90% bare ground
# 2	Semi-arid land	⩾25% to <90% bare ground
# 3	Dense short vegetation	0% to <25% bare ground
# 4	Open tree cover	⩾3 and (<10 m or <70% tree cover)
# 5	Dense tree cover	⩾10 m and ⩾70% tree cover
# 6	Recent tree cover gain	Recent ⩾3 m and ⩾10% tree cover
# 7	Non-fire loss no trees, no cropland, no built-up
