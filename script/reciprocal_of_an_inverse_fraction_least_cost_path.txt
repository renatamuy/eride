# transforming resistance into least cost -------------------
# Apply the multiplicative inverse
# Less people (10 / sqkm) - more resistance to spread
1/10
# More people (801/sqkm) - less resistance to spread
1/801.57
# Get the reciprocal back to find the original density value

# A lot of people - resistance almost zero
